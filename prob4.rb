# Largest palindrome product
# A palindromic number reads the same both ways. The largest palindrome 
# made from the product of two 2-digit numbers is 9009 = 91 Ã— 99.

# ====================================
#  			REFLECTION
# ====================================

# When I was solving this problem, I had a personal dilemma of whether or not I 
# should use built in methods in Ruby to solve the problem. 

# As much as I love Ruby for the ease of use and the many built-in methods to 
# sort, or reverse, or split, etc, should I use them? Like, should I use 
# Prime library to get my prime numbers, or should I do it 'manually' by 
# writing my own Eratosthenes Sieve? Sometimes I feel that I am being spoilt 
# by these shortcuts. After all, I am doing these problems for personal 
# improvement.

# I guess, for the time being, I will try to refrain myself from using them,
# as much as I could in simpler problems.
